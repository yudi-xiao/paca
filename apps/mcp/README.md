# Paca MCP Server

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Paca — an open-source, AI-native project management platform.

Connect your AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, etc.) to your Paca workspace and manage projects, tasks, sprints, and documents using natural language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A running Paca instance (local or deployed)
- A delegated Agent Auth enrollment file, a Runner-issued Capability Broker session, or a legacy Paca API key

## Setup

No installation or build step required. Configure your AI agent client to use the MCP server directly via `npx`.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PACA_AGENT_CONFIG` | One auth mode | — | Absolute path to a local delegated Agent enrollment file; it must be a regular, non-symlink `0600` file |
| `PACA_CAPABILITY_BROKER_URL` / `PACA_CAPABILITY_BROKER_TOKEN` / `PACA_CAPABILITY_BROKER_CONFIG` | One auth mode | — | Runner-managed sandbox mode; all three are required and are mutually exclusive with private Agent config and API key |
| `PACA_AGENT_HARNESS_KIND` | ❌ | `custom` | `cloudflare-agent`, `codex`, `claude-code`, `deepseek`, or `custom`; presence metadata only, not a permission source |
| `PACA_AGENT_HARNESS_VERSION` | ❌ | — | Harness version reported with Host presence |
| `PACA_AGENT_HARNESS_INSTANCE_ID` | ❌ | — | Local Harness instance identifier reported with Host presence |
| `PACA_API_KEY` | One auth mode | — | Legacy user/integration API key; mutually exclusive with `PACA_AGENT_CONFIG` |
| `PACA_API_URL` | ❌ | `http://localhost:8080` | URL of your Paca API instance |
| `PACA_AGENT_ID` | ❌ | — | Agent UUID — set to connect as a specific ACP agent instead of yourself (see Agent Mode below) |
| `PACA_PROJECT_ID` | ❌ | — | Project UUID to pin every tool call to a single project. Optional even when `PACA_AGENT_ID` is set — a global agent left unset here runs "unpinned" across every project it's invited into |

### Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop config file:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving. Claude will automatically have access to all Paca tools.

### VS Code (GitHub Copilot)

Add to your VS Code `settings.json` or `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "paca": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
        "env": {
          "PACA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
          "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP-Compatible Clients

Any MCP-compatible client can use the server with:

```json
{
  "name": "paca",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
  "env": {
    "PACA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
    "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080"
  }
}
```

For a full setup walkthrough, see the [MCP Server Setup Guide](../../docs/guides/mcp-server-setup.md).

## Agent & User Permissions

The MCP server supports three mutually exclusive authentication paths. Direct Agent Auth is preferred for a controlled local Codex, Claude Code, DeepSeek, or custom Harness. Runner-managed sandboxes use the internal Capability Broker mode. The API-key path remains only for users and legacy integrations during migration.

### Agent Auth Harness Mode

Set `PACA_AGENT_CONFIG` to the delegated Agent configuration written by the Paca Host enrollment flow. Do not set `PACA_API_KEY` in the same process.

```json
{
  "name": "paca",
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/absolute/path/to/paca/apps/mcp/build/index.js"],
  "env": {
    "PACA_AGENT_CONFIG": "/absolute/path/to/delegated-agent.json",
    "PACA_AGENT_HARNESS_KIND": "codex",
    "PACA_AGENT_HARNESS_VERSION": "1.0.0",
    "PACA_AGENT_HARNESS_INSTANCE_ID": "local-machine-1",
    "PACA_PROJECT_ID": "project-uuid"
  }
}
```

In this mode:

1. The enrollment file is rejected unless it is a private regular file with mode `0600`; symlinks, malformed endpoints, mismatched Ed25519 keys, and oversized files fail closed.
2. Each request receives a new 45-second Agent JWT with a unique `jti`. Redirects are refused, and the token audience is pinned to the enrolled Capability endpoint.
3. Only tools represented by both the enrolled capability list and a requested Grant scope are exposed. Current tools cover exact project reads, task reads, single-field task writes, constrained task creation, executable-task discovery, document snapshots, version-checked text block edits, durable document workflow runs, and short-lived environment connections. Execute-mode environment connections are prepared before being returned; the client retries at most three times with the same idempotent request ID, and only when the server explicitly returns bounded `retryable` guidance.
4. Project, task, field, operation mode, Organization, and validity constraints are checked locally before the request and authoritatively checked again by Paca against the current active Grant. Delegated execution remains intersected with the user's current Paca permissions.
5. `get_document` returns the current revision, Yjs state vector, block IDs, and block versions. `edit_document` only accepts small block-scoped replacements in `suggest` or `collaborate` mode; stale versions are rejected or returned as conflicts by DocumentParty instead of replacing the whole document.
6. `start_document_workflow` requires both matching `workflow.execute` and `document.edit` Grants, then starts the existing Cloudflare Workflow and AgentDO run. `get_agent_run` and `cancel_agent_run` read or request cancellation of runs owned by the current Agent; cancellation does not imply content rollback.
7. `discover_tasks` reports Host/Harness presence before discovery so server-side matching can use approved labels and current online state.
8. `connect_environment` requires an exact `environment.connect` Grant for the project, environment, and `read` or `execute` mode. It generates a fresh idempotency request ID and returns only the server-issued short-lived connection result. Harnesses must keep the returned access token in memory and must never log or persist it.

The private enrollment file belongs only on the controlled Host. Do not copy or mount it into a Cloudflare Computer/Sandbox workload.

### Runner-managed Capability Broker Mode

`services/agent-runner` creates these values for a Project-scoped conversation; operators and end users should not create them manually. In an ephemeral sandbox they are ordinary process environment values. In a static Environment the Runner stores them temporarily under a conversation-unique `PACA_SESSION_<UUID>_*` namespace in Goose's secret store, passes only that namespace through the non-sensitive `--paca-env-prefix` argument, and deletes the stored values immediately after `session/new` or `session/load` has spawned the MCP subprocess. A resumed conversation deliberately reuses the same namespace so Goose's persisted extension definition remains valid, while each turn still receives a newly issued bearer. The MCP bootstrap clears inherited legacy auth values before restoring the namespaced broker values.

The config is a base64url-encoded public summary containing only the Agent ID, Project ID, capabilities, and matching Grant requests. The opaque bearer is not an Agent JWT and cannot be used against Paca directly. The Broker indexes sessions by a SHA-256 digest instead of the raw bearer; the bearer is never persisted or logged, its 45-minute idle expiry refreshes only on valid use, and teardown or the end of a static-Environment turn revokes it. Every accepted upstream request receives a fresh 45-second Agent JWT.

Broker mode rejects Project escape paths, URL/query/header forwarding, unknown JSON fields, unsupported methods, oversized requests, and capabilities outside its public summary. `task.execute` remains in the Runner lease coordinator, while `environment.connect`, repository/plugin tools, executable-task discovery, and Host heartbeat are not exposed by the first broker contract.

### Agent Mode vs. User Mode

| Mode | Trigger | API Key Source | Permission Source | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Agent Single-Project** | `PACA_AGENT_ID` + `PACA_PROJECT_ID` | That agent's own `PACA_API_KEY` | Agent's permissions in the specified project | Single project only |
| **Agent Global** | `PACA_AGENT_ID` only (no `PACA_PROJECT_ID`) | That agent's own `PACA_API_KEY` | Agent's global role, plus its per-project permissions resolved as each tool call needs them | Every project the agent is invited into |
| **User Single-Project** | `PACA_PROJECT_ID` only (no `PACA_AGENT_ID`) | User's personal API key | User's global + project permissions | Single project |
| **User Global** | Neither set | User's personal API key | User's global permissions only | All projects (no project-scoped tools) |

**Note**: Each ACP agent has its own `PACA_API_KEY`, generated per-agent — not a key shared across every agent in the deployment. Generate (or regenerate) it from the agent's setup page in the Paca UI; regenerating immediately invalidates whatever key was live before, since only one key is ever active per agent.

### Agent Mode

Set `PACA_AGENT_ID` to connect as a specific ACP agent instead of as yourself. Add `PACA_PROJECT_ID` too if you want every tool call pinned to one project (recommended for a project-scoped agent); leave it unset for a global agent, which can then work across any project it's been invited into.

1. **Authentication**: Uses that agent's own `PACA_API_KEY` — the key itself identifies the agent, so no separate impersonation header is needed or honored
2. **Permission Fetch**: With `PACA_PROJECT_ID` set, only that project's permissions are fetched; without it, the agent's global role and per-project permissions are resolved as each tool call needs them
3. **Tool Filtering**: Shows only tools the agent has permission to use
4. **Project Validation**: With `PACA_PROJECT_ID` set, enforces that all tool calls use that project ID
5. **Performance**: Single-project mode is optimized for that common case (one API call at startup)

**How to Get the Agent's API Key:**

Generate it from the agent's setup page in the Paca UI (Project → Agents → the agent → "Generate key" under the local bridge setup steps). The plaintext is shown once — copy it immediately, since only its SHA-256 hash is stored server-side. It's also available via the API directly: `POST /projects/:projectId/agents/:agentId/mcp-agent-key` for a project agent, or `POST /admin/agents/:agentId/mcp-agent-key` for a global agent.

**Configuration (single-project):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "agent-mcp-key-from-above",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "PACA_AGENT_ID": "your-agent-uuid-here",
        "PACA_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-uuid-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration (global agent, unpinned across every invited project):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "agent-mcp-key-from-above",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "PACA_AGENT_ID": "your-agent-uuid-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**User configuration** (optional single-project mode):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "PACA_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-uuid-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### User Mode (No Agent ID)

When `PACA_AGENT_ID` is not set:

1. **Authentication**: Uses user's personal API key (from Settings → API Keys)
2. **No Impersonation**: Acts as the authenticated user directly
3. **Global Permissions**: Fetches global permissions via `GET /api/v1/users/me/global-permissions`
4. **Tool Filtering**: Shows only globally permitted tools (no project-scoped tools)
5. **Best Practice**: Set `PACA_PROJECT_ID` to filter tools at the MCP level and reduce API errors

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "your-personal-api-key-here",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**To add project scope:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "your-personal-api-key-here",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "PACA_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-uuid-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Without `PACA_PROJECT_ID`, project-scoped tools (like `list_tasks`, `create_task`) will not be available.

### Configuring Permissions

**For Agents:**
1. **Add Agent as Project Member**: Add the agent to the desired projects with appropriate roles
2. **Configure Role Permissions**: Ensure the assigned roles have the necessary permissions
3. **Restart MCP Server**: Restart the MCP server to refresh the permission cache

**Important**: When using agent mode, `PACA_API_KEY` must be that agent's own key (see "How to Get the Agent's API Key" above) — the key itself is what identifies the agent to the server, so `PACA_AGENT_ID` alone is not a claim the server will trust from any other key.

**For Users:**
1. **Assign Global Roles**: Grant users global permissions through their global roles
2. **Add to Projects**: Add users to projects with appropriate project roles
3. **Configure Project Roles**: Ensure project roles have the necessary permissions
4. **Restart MCP Server**: Restart the MCP server to refresh the permission cache

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "PACA_AGENT_ID": "your-agent-uuid-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: The MCP server automatically filters tools based on your permissions:
- **With `PACA_AGENT_ID`**: Filters tools based on the agent's project permissions
- **Without `PACA_AGENT_ID`**: Filters tools based on your personal user permissions (including global permissions)

If permission fetching fails, all tools will be shown to maintain backward compatibility.

For a complete list of all tools with detailed descriptions, see [ALL_TOOLS.md](./ALL_TOOLS.md).

### 🔌 Plugin Tools

Installed Paca plugins can contribute additional MCP tools. When the server starts it fetches `GET /api/v1/plugins`, and for each enabled plugin that declares an `mcp.remoteEntryUrl` in its manifest, dynamically loads the plugin's tool module and merges its tools into the list above.

Plugin tools appear alongside core tools — there is no distinction from the AI client's perspective.

To add MCP tools to your own plugin, see the [MCP Plugin System](../../docs/plugins/mcp-plugin-system.md) docs and the [`@paca-ai/plugin-sdk-mcp`](../../plugin-sdk-mcp/README.md) SDK.

## Markdown/BlockNote Conversion

The MCP server automatically handles conversion between Markdown and BlockNote JSON format:

- **Reading**: Fetches content as BlockNote JSON and converts to Markdown for readability
- **Writing**: Accepts Markdown input and converts to BlockNote JSON for storage

This allows AI assistants to work with familiar Markdown format while the API stores content in BlockNote's rich text format.

## Legacy API Key Authentication

Legacy tools authenticate via the `X-API-Key` header. Generate an API key in your Paca user settings and set it as `PACA_API_KEY` in your MCP client configuration. This mode must not be used as the long-term identity for an Agent Runner.

## Examples

### Create a Task with Markdown Description

```
Tool: create_task
Arguments:
- projectId: "project-uuid"
- title: "Implement user authentication"
- description: "# Implementation Plan\n\n## Steps\n1. Create auth service\n2. Add login endpoint\n3. Implement JWT tokens"
- statusId: "status-uuid"
- importance: 5
- tags: ["auth", "backend"]
```

### Update Document Content

```
Tool: update_document
Arguments:
- projectId: "project-uuid"
- docId: "doc-uuid"
- content: "# System Design\n\n## Architecture\nThis document describes the..."
```

## Notes

- The server requires a running Paca API instance
- API keys can be created through the Paca web interface under user settings
- All descriptions and document contents are automatically converted between Markdown and BlockNote format
- Date fields should be provided in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`)
