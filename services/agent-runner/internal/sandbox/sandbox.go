	// full 10s every time — goose serve does not appear to handle SIGTERM
	// for a fast graceful exit. An earlier version of this constant was
	// 30s, chosen without that data; that made HandleControl's stop path
	// (see internal/handler) take ~30s end to end in practice, since
	// Handle doesn't return until this deferred call does. There's

// one backend's package could construct a Handle at all, since Go doesn't
// allow setting unexported fields from another package — a real
